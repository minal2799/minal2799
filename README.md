 ## Who’s Minal and What’s She Building in Data? 👩‍💻📊

Hi 👋 I’m an aspiring **Data Analyst** actively building hands-on analytics projects to strengthen my skills and prepare for full-time **Data Analyst / Business Analyst** roles.

While I don’t yet have industry experience, I’ve worked extensively on **real-world, project-based analyses** using Python, SQL Server, and Power BI. My work covers the complete analytics workflow — from data cleaning and feature engineering to exploratory analysis, SQL-based insights, and interactive dashboard creation. All of these projects are available here on my GitHub.

I’m particularly interested in **customer behavior analysis, business performance metrics, and data storytelling**, and I enjoy using data to answer practical business questions. I’m continuously learning by working with diverse datasets and improving my analytical and problem-solving skills.

✨ My goal is to apply these skills in a full-time role where I can contribute to data-driven decision-making and continue growing as a data professional.
